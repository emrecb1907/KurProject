Independently of their ethnic or geographical identities, these states undertook important duties such as ensuring order in their own regions, developing scientific and cultural activities, and keeping trade alive. Therefore, this period is evaluated as a process where more than one power existed together in a wide geography rather than a single-centered structure."
