                "Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was born around 570 CE in Mecca. At that time, Mecca was the center of both trade and polytheistic beliefs. Society was divided among tribes, with sharp social class distinctions. In such an environment, his life progressed differently from those around him, starting from his childhood years."

                "Prophet Muhammad became an orphan at a young age; he first grew up with his grandfather Abdulmuttalib, then with his uncle Abu Talib. This situation did not make him a bitter person; on the contrary, it helped him learn empathy and justice very early. He developed a stance of not oppressing anyone and standing up for the weak.",
                "One of the prominent characteristics in Mecca's social life during his youth was his honesty. In a society accustomed to deception in trade, his honesty stood out. People began calling him \"Muhammad al-Amin,\" meaning the Trustworthy Muhammad. It's particularly noteworthy that this title was given to him by his society, not himself; it's one of the strongest signs of the impression his character left on society."

                "The trade journeys he made at a young age introduced him to cultures outside of Mecca. He had the opportunity to observe the lives, beliefs, and behaviors of different communities. These observations opened a broad horizon for him: He realized that despite their differences, people shared a common search for justice and mercy.",
                "The honesty and reliability he showed in trade caravans led to his meeting with Lady Khadijah. The care and justice he demonstrated in his trade work for her was on everyone's lips."

            "text": [
                "In Meccan society, there was a system where the strong oppressed the weak, and women and orphans often could not defend their rights. Prophet Muhammad was one of those who stood against these injustices. His participation at a young age in the Hilf al-Fudul pact—a community established to defend the rights of the oppressed—shows how strong his sense of justice was from an early age."

                "Polytheism was widespread in the society he lived in; however, Prophet Muhammad never turned to this form of belief. He loved to retreat from the noise of Mecca and contemplate. His withdrawal to the Cave of Hira shows that his inner world was shaped by silence and the search for meaning. This solitude was not an escape; it was an effort to think more deeply about life, humanity, and justice."
