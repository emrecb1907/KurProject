This process was a period when the political structure began to institutionalize and the state mechanism became more distinct. The Umayyads marked the early phase of Islamic history as the first major representative of this transition."

                "The rise of the Umayyads to power coincided with a period when the need to strengthen central authority in Islamic society came to the fore. In this period, state administration evolved towards a structure that was more systematic and where administrative boards became distinct. Continuity in administration and preservation of public order were among the main goals of Umayyad politics."

Damascus was a strong city in terms of trade routes, population density, and regional ties. Therefore, the administrative functioning of the state could be organized faster here. This choice also played an important role in the expansion of the cultural and political horizons of the Islamic world."

The bureaucratic structure necessary for the state to govern a wide geography became distinct in this period. These structural arrangements formed a foundation that would serve as a model for later states."

This expansion led to the emergence of new cities in different regions and increased cultural interactions. The state administration tried to establish balanced relations with both local administrators and the public to manage this diversity."

The institutionalization of the foundations of Quran, hadith, and language sciences is one of the important features of this period. Although there was not as intense an intellectual movement as in the proceeding \"Golden Age\", the basic infrastructure was created in this period."
