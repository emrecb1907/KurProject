            en: `Before the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) began his prophetic mission, a distinct social structure prevailed in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Mecca. This period is generally referred to as the Age of Ignorance (Jahiliyyah).

The Age of Ignorance refers not so much to a lack of knowledge, but rather to the corruption in matters of faith and morals. People mostly worshipped idols, and belief in Allah had either weakened or was practiced in distorted ways. The Kaaba, although built as a place of worship for Allah, had been filled with idols.

In society, the powerful oppressed the weak, and justice was administered according to personal interests. Women and children were often undervalued, and in some regions, female infants were subjected to great cruelty. Drinking, gambling, and unlawful gain were common behaviors.

Nevertheless, trade had flourished in Meccan society. Mecca was situated on important trade routes and maintained economic relations with surrounding regions. However, this commercial vitality was not supported by a moral balance.

The Prophet (PBUH) was born into such an environment and lived in such a society. These conditions are of great importance for understanding why a prophet was needed and why Islam brought about such a powerful transformation.

This lesson provides a foundation for understanding the circumstances in which the message brought by our Prophet emerged.

游늷 Purpose of the lesson:
This lesson aims to introduce pre-Islamic Meccan society, helping to understand why the Prophet's mission was necessary.`

            en: `The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born in Mecca in 571 CE. The year of his birth was a significant year in Arab society, known as the Year of the Elephant. This event is recognized as a remarkable occurrence demonstrating Allah's protection of the Kaaba.

The Prophet's father, Abdullah, had passed away before his birth. Therefore, the Prophet came into this world as an orphan. His mother, Lady Aminah, tried to raise him with great love; however, the Prophet lost his mother at a young age as well. After his mother's passing, he came under the care of his grandfather, Abdul-Muttalib.

His grandfather Abdul-Muttalib loved the Prophet dearly and showed him special attention. However, when the Prophet was only eight years old, he lost his grandfather too. Subsequently, his uncle Abu Talib took over the Prophet's care and raised him without distinguishing him from his own children.

The Prophet (PBUH) stood out during his childhood years for his honesty, calmness, and trustworthiness. He would stay away from the wrongful behaviors of his peers and disliked quarrels and bad habits.

The losses he experienced at such an early age played an important role in the Prophet developing a compassionate, patient, and understanding character. Growing up as an orphan led him to feel deep compassion, especially towards the weak and the helpless.

Although the Prophet's childhood was filled with hardships, these difficulties became stepping stones that matured his character. This period marked the years when the foundations of patience and mercy that the Prophet would later demonstrate were laid.

游늷 Purpose of the lesson:
This lesson aims to introduce the childhood years of the Prophet, helping to understand his human aspect and character development.`

            en: `The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was a person known in society for his honesty, trustworthiness, and moral character even before his prophetic mission. He displayed an exemplary personality in his life before prophethood as well.

In his youth, he engaged in trade. In Meccan society, trade was an important source of livelihood, and people preferred to do business with trustworthy individuals. The Prophet quickly gained trust through his honesty and fairness in commerce.

Because of this trustworthiness, the Meccans gave him the title "Al-Amin," meaning "the trustworthy one." People would entrust their goods and valuables to him with confidence. This demonstrates that he possessed a strong moral standing even before prophethood.

The Prophet (PBUH) stayed away from the idolatry, alcohol consumption, and moral corruption prevalent in society during his youth. He disliked gatherings where injustice was practiced and tried not to remain silent against unfairness. This attitude was an indication of the importance he placed on truthfulness and justice.

During this period, he married Lady Khadijah. This marriage was an exemplary union built on love, respect, and trust. Lady Khadijah greatly valued the Prophet's honesty and morals and always supported him.

Before prophethood, the Prophet often preferred solitude and gave importance to reflection and contemplation. The time he spent in the Cave of Hira, in particular, shows the depth of his inner world and his search for truth.

This period was a process in which the Prophet prepared morally, mentally, and spiritually for prophethood. This solid stance in his life clearly demonstrates that prophethood was not a coincidence but was built upon a strong character.

游늷 Purpose of the lesson:
This lesson aims to introduce the Prophet's life before prophethood, helping to understand how his trustworthiness and moral standing laid the groundwork for his prophetic mission.`

            en: `As the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) approached the age of forty, he was troubled by the corruption in society and preferred to be alone with his thoughts. For this purpose, he would frequently retreat to the Cave of Hira near Mecca, where he would engage in contemplation.

This period was an indication of his search for truth and the depth of his inner world. It was during this time that the great event that would change the course of human history took place.

One day, while he was in the Cave of Hira, the Angel Gabriel (Jibril) came to him and brought divine revelation from Allah. The first command conveyed to the Prophet was "Read" (Iqra). This event marked the moment when his prophetic mission began.

The first revelation profoundly affected the Prophet. He felt great excitement and a sense of responsibility in the face of this extraordinary experience. After leaving the cave, he returned home and told his wife, Lady Khadijah, what had happened. Lady Khadijah believed in him, supported him, and comforted him.

Lady Khadijah reminded him of his truthfulness, trustworthiness, and noble character, and said that Allah would never forsake him. Thus, Lady Khadijah became the first person to embrace faith.

After this event, the Prophet was entrusted with the mission of conveying the revelations he received from Allah to people. However, this mission did not immediately begin with an open invitation. The initial period was a phase of secret invitation to those close to him.

The first revelation was a beginning that changed not only the Prophet's life but the direction of all humanity. This event constituted the birth of Islam and the foundation of the process of conveying the message.

游늷 Purpose of the lesson:
This lesson aims to help understand how prophethood began and the meaning of the first revelation, thereby comprehending the great responsibility the Prophet carried.`

            en: `After the beginning of prophethood, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) began inviting people to the oneness of Allah. This invitation contradicted the established beliefs and system of interests in Meccan society.

In the initial period, the invitation was made secretly and was limited to those close to him. During this process, the number of believers was small, but their faith was strong. As the invitation became public over time, the leaders of Mecca became disturbed by this call.

The fear that the system based on idol worship would be disrupted increased pressure and hostility against the Prophet and Muslims. Muslims were mocked, ostracized, and subjected to various forms of abuse. Particularly the weak and helpless Muslims faced severe torture.

The Prophet (PBUH) never resorted to violence in the face of these hardships. He continued his mission with patience, mercy, and determination. He adopted an inviting manner rather than a harsh approach toward people.

During this period, Muslims faced severe social and economic sanctions such as boycotts. Despite this, they did not abandon their faith. These difficulties further strengthened the solidarity and beliefs of the Muslims.

The Meccan period was important not so much for the spread of Islam, but for the strengthening of faith and the reinforcement of moral standing. This process was a period in which the finest examples of patience, sacrifice, and determination were witnessed.

游늷 Purpose of the lesson:
This lesson aims to help understand the Prophet's patience and the resistance Muslims showed for their faith by describing the hardships experienced during the Meccan period.`

            en: `During the Meccan period, persecution against Muslims had gradually increased, and it had become nearly impossible to perform worship and practice their beliefs. Under these circumstances, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), with Allah's permission, decided to migrate from Mecca to Medina.

The Hijrah is not merely a journey from one city to another. The Hijrah means protecting one's faith, being able to practice one's beliefs freely, and making sacrifices for the sake of Allah.

The Prophet acted with great caution and prudence during the migration. When leaving Mecca, despite his life being in danger, he never lost his trust in Allah. Abu Bakr was with him on this journey. The hardships experienced presented the finest examples of patience and trust in Allah (tawakkul).

The people of Medina welcomed the Prophet with great joy and excitement. This welcome marked the beginning of a new era for Muslims. Muslims had now found a homeland where they could practice their faith in a freer environment.

The Hijrah is a significant turning point in Islamic history. This event meant not only a geographical change for Muslims but also a social, moral, and religious transformation. For this reason, the Hijrah has been accepted as the beginning of the Islamic calendar.

游늷 Purpose of the lesson:
This lesson aims to help understand the value of sacrifice made for faith by explaining the meaning and significance of the Hijrah.`

            en: `After the Hijrah, a new era began for the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and the Muslims. Medina became the first place where Islam was lived not only as an individual belief but also as a social order.

After arriving in Medina, the Prophet first focused on establishing social unity and order. A bond of brotherhood was established among Muslims. This brotherhood was not merely nominal; it was a genuine unity built on sharing and solidarity.

Different religious groups lived together in Medina. The Prophet took the principles of justice and peace as the foundation among these differences. A system was established that protected the rights of everyone in society.

During this period, the Prophet served not only as a prophet but also as a leader, an arbiter, and a guide. He upheld justice in his decisions, treated people with compassion, and resolved problems with wisdom.

The Medinan period was a time when Islam integrated with morals, law, and social life. Acts of worship became regular, and awareness of social responsibility strengthened.

This period is the clearest example of Islam's transformation from an individual belief into a lived way of life.

游늷 Purpose of the lesson:
This lesson aims to help understand that Islam is a religion encompassing all aspects of life by introducing the social order established in the Medinan period and the Prophet's leadership qualities.`

            en: `Years after the Hijrah, the Muslim community had grown stronger in Medina and achieved an organized structure. The developments during this period paved the way for the conquest of Mecca. The conquest of Mecca is considered in Islamic history not merely as a military success but as the pinnacle of morals and mercy.

When the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) entered Mecca with a large army, the city surrendered almost without resistance. Many who had persecuted him and the Muslims for years were anxious that day. However, the Prophet did not choose the path of revenge.

He declared a general amnesty to the people of Mecca. Saying "There is no reproach against you today," he forgave the oppression of the past. This behavior was a powerful example showing that justice and mercy should not be abandoned even when power is attained.

With the conquest of Mecca, the Kaaba was cleansed of idols. The Kaaba was once again made the center of monotheism (tawhid). This event was one of the clearest indicators that the message of Islam had been permanently established.

After the conquest, many people voluntarily accepted Islam. People were deeply affected by the Prophet's forgiving nature and justice. Islam spread not by force but through morals and exemplary conduct.

During this period, the Prophet began conveying his final messages to people. Fundamental values such as social justice, rights of others, equality, and brotherhood were clearly emphasized. These years were the period when Islam was completed and the message became clear.

游늷 Purpose of the lesson:
This lesson aims to help understand how power combines with mercy by describing the conquest of Mecca and the Prophet's moral stance in his final years.`

            en: `Throughout his life, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) conveyed Allah's message to people in the most accurate manner. While fulfilling his mission of conveying the message, he took patience, mercy, and justice as his foundation. In the final period of his life, he made important reminders to his ummah.

The Prophet (PBUH), in the time close to his passing, particularly advised people to pay attention to the rights of others, and to be just and merciful to one another. He wanted people to maintain their devotion to Allah and keep their consciousness of worship alive.

He continued to lead a simple life in his final days. He did not value worldly possessions or status. This attitude shows that he fulfilled his prophetic duty not as a means of superiority but with a sense of responsibility.

The passing of the Prophet was a source of deep sorrow for the Muslims. However, this passing did not mean that his message had ended. On the contrary, the Quran he left behind and his exemplary life showed that his path continued.

The Prophet (PBUH) left his ummah not a written inheritance but a moral character learned through living. Values such as truthfulness, justice, mercy, patience, and brotherhood were clearly visible in his life.

Today, the life of the Prophet is not merely a history that took place in the past. His example is a living guide that shows people the way in every era. To understand him is not just to learn about his life; it is to carry his morals into life itself.

游늷 Purpose of the lesson:
This lesson aims to meaningfully and consciously complete the Siyer module by describing the Prophet's passing and the spiritual legacy he left to the ummah.`

Listen to my words carefully, for I do not know whether after this year I shall ever meet you again in this place.

O people,
Just as this day is sacred, this month is sacred, and this city is sacred,
so are your lives, your property, and your honor sacred.
They are inviolable.

Remember that you will meet your Lord,
and He will call you to account for your deeds.
Do not return after me to disbelief by striking the necks of one another.

O people,
I urge you to fear Allah concerning women.
You have taken them as a trust from Allah,
and they have rights over you, just as you have rights over them.

O people,
All interest (usury) from the time of ignorance is abolished.
All such interest is cancelled,
and the first interest I abolish is that of my uncle, Abbas ibn Abdul Muttalib.

All blood feuds from the time of ignorance are also abolished.
The first blood claim I abolish is that of Iyas ibn Rabi'a,
the grandson of Abdul Muttalib.

O people,
Indeed, Satan has despaired of ever being worshipped in this land.
But he will be pleased if he is obeyed in matters you consider small.
So beware of him in order to protect your religion.

O people,
Your Lord is One,
and your father is one.
You are all from Adam, and Adam was created from dust.
There is no superiority of an Arab over a non-Arab,
nor of a non-Arab over an Arab;
neither white over black, nor black over white,
except by righteousness and piety.

O people,
Listen to my words and remember them well.
Every Muslim is a brother to another Muslim,
and all Muslims are brothers.

I leave among you two things.
If you hold firmly to them, you will never go astray:
the Book of Allah (the Qur'an) and the Sunnah of His Prophet.

O people,
Let those who are present convey my words to those who are absent.
Perhaps the one who receives the message will understand it better than the one who heard it directly.

Bear witness, O Allah.
Bear witness, O Allah.
Bear witness, O Allah.
